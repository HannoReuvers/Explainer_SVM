## Explainer Support Vector Machines

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm originally developed for classification. This repository includes a collection of study materials offering a general introduction to the topic.

You are invited to start reading the document *SVM_explainer.pdf* in the folder entitled `explainer` to get started. Seperate notebooks allow you to get some hands-on practice and deepen your understanding.
